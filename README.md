# My Python Portfolio
In this repository you can see two folders: *python_learning* and *python_practice*.

The *python_learning* forder contains other folders sorted by chapters. Those
folders holds python code. Also, there is the *python_book_projects(practice)*
folder in which I made the projects (A game, Data analisys, An web-app.)
from the book (Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes) that I read. It was done in order to
practice and consolidate the knowledge gained. *python_learning* reflects my
learning of the python programming language and the first immersing into the
programming world.

The *python_practice* includes the projects I came up with and implemented during
python learning. There are *tutor_projects*, *my_projects* and *my_python_studies*
in that folder:
    *tutor_projects* - contains python projects I made with youtube or any other
     tutorials.
    *my_projects* - stores my implemented ideas(there are an web-application,
     data analisys, games and other console scripts in the folder.)
    *my_python_studies* - When I learned about new interesting things about python
     I tested them in the python files and saved them in *my_python_studies*.
